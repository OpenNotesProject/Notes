==Red==**ox** means ==Reduction== and **Oxidation**

### Oxidation Reaction
 $$\ce{Mg(s) -> Mg+2(s) + 2e-}$$
Oxidation is loss of $e-$ 

---
### Reduction Reaction

$$ \ce{O2(s) + 4e- -> 2O-}$$
Reduction is gaining $\ce{e-}$


### Redox equations 
Redox equations are a Oxidisation reaction and a Reduction reaction written together 

$$\ce{O2(s) +4e- +2Mg(s)-> 2O- + 2Mg+(s) +4e-}$$
If it has the same number of electrons on both sides you can remove them. They are like spectator ions
$$\ce{O2(s) +2Mg(s)-> 2O- + 2Mg+(s)}$$
