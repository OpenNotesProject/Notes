## Nuclear Fusion
Nuclear Fusion is when **2 atoms are fused together**. Nuclear fusion releases an **ungodly amount of energy**. Nuclear Fusion is what **stars do**. 

## Radio isotopes
Isotopes that are unstable (radioisotopes) **emit** radiation to **become stable**.
Radioactivity comes as a result of a nucleus that is unstable breaking down, **releasing energy**

## Radioactive decay
There are **3** types of radiation (as far as we know):
- α (alpha)
- β(Beta)
- γ(Gamma)
### Alpha
$$\ce{^4_2He^2+ (Helium Nucleus)}$$
Alpha particles are made up of **two protons** and **two neutrons**.
This makes them identical to a **helium nucleus**
Can be stopped by a **sheet of paper** or a few cm of air.


### Beta
$$\ce{^0_-1e- (High energy electron from the neucleus)}$$
Beta particles are **fast, high-energy electrons** emitted from the **nucleus**.
Can be stopped by a few cm of aluminium.
They are created when a **neutron** decays into **a proton** and emits an electron and a neutrino.
$$\ce{n->p+ +e-}$$

### Gama Rays

Its just very excited light. It is a **high energy electromagnetic wave**. 
Can be stopped by thick Concrete/Lead



## Nuclear Equations

> [!NOTE] 
> Nuclear Equations are written in ==Nuclide notation (ADD LINK TO NOTE)==



### Alpha Decay
$$\ce{^238_92U ~->\alpha-decay->~^234_90Th+ ^4_2He}$$
$$\ce{Uranium-238~nucleus(parent nucleus)->Thorium(daughter nucleus) + \alpha~particle}$$
- Nuclide notation for all particles
- Mass no.s are balanced
- Atomic no.s are balanced

### Beta Decay
$$\ce{^24_11Na->\beta-decay->+ ^24_12Mg +^0_-1e}$$
$$\ce{Sodium -> Magnesium(1 more proton than Sodium) + 1 electon + 1 nutrino}$$


> [!NOTE] How to write neutrons and protons in Nuclide notation
> **Neutron**$$\ce{^1_0n}$$
> 
> **Proton** $$\ce{^1_1p}$$

### Bombardment
**Bombardment** is when an atom is shot with another particle in order to induce a nuclear reaction. 
#### Example:
Write a nuclear equation for a *Sodium-23* isotope getting bombarded with a **proton**, releasing an alpha particle and a new neon isotope:
$$\ce{^23_11Na + ^1_1p -> ^20_10Ne + ^4_2He}$$
