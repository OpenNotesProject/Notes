### Optical Telescopes
They detect visible **light**. The bigger the telescope the more and further it can see. Cannot be used in bad weather or during the day since they see with visible light. Can be gotten for **quite cheap**.


### Radio Telescopes 
They detect **radio waves**. Stars and other celestial body give out not just light but every part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Radio telescopes are used from the surface of the earth because the **atmosphere does not block** as radio waves as much as the other parts of the EM spectrum. Radio telescopes can be used in bad weather since it does not use visible light but they are very expensive and need to be **very** large.

### Space Telescopes
The can detect **all of the EM spectrum** since it is not blocked by the atmosphere. Can be manoeuvred around space but difficult to launch and maintain. **REALLY EXPENSIVE**.
