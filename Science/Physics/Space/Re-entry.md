When spacecraft re-enter the atmosphere there is massive amounts of friction that create large amounts of heat. The faster something travels the more it is impacted by friction.
$$Ek = 1/2mv^2~~or~Ew=Fd$$
$$Eh=cmΔt$$
$$Eh=mL$$
During re-entry the spacecraft has large amounts of kinetic potential energy, it is slowed down by air resistance/friction. The kinetic energy of the spacecraft is converted into heat though friction, therefore slowing it down. This causes the spacecraft to get unbelievably hot necessitating **very** good insulation materials in the heat shield.

> Some of the energy may not be lost to heat but to other factors like light and sound.
